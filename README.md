This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL to perform advanced analysis and derive meaningful insights. The dataset includes COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population statistics. Key highlights of this project include:

Data Exploration: Filtering, organizing, and preparing COVID-19 data by location, date, and continent.

Case and Mortality Analysis:
Tracking total cases and deaths by country and continent.
Calculating death percentages relative to total cases.
Identifying countries with the highest infection and death rates.

Vaccination Analysis:
Comparing vaccination progress with population data using joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and temporary tables.
Calculating the percentage of vaccinated population globally and by region.

Data Storage for Visualization:
Creating SQL views to simplify visualization and analysis, including:
Infection rates by population.
Death rates by population and continent.
Vaccination progress as a percentage of total population.

Global Metrics: Aggregating and summarizing total cases, deaths, and vaccination percentages for global analysis.
